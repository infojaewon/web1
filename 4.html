  <h2>object C</h2>
    <p>
      Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style
      messaging to the C programming language. It was the main programming language used by Apple for
      the OS X and iOS operating systems, and their respective application programming interfaces (APIs)
      Cocoa and Cocoa Touch prior to the introduction of Swift.
      The programming language Objective-C was originally developed in the early 1980s. It was selected as
      he main language used by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system, from which OS X and iOS are derived.[3]
      Portable Objective-C programs that do not use the Cocoa or Cocoa Touch libraries, or those using parts t
      hat may be ported or reimplemented for other systems, can also be compiled for any system supported by
      GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) or Clang.
