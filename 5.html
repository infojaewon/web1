<p> As protesters, predominantly young ones, brought down regimes in Tunisia and Egypt, and have fought for democracy in Libya, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, and even Saudi Arabia (if only a handful of demonstrators, quickly suppressed), Koreans would naturally think of the decades-long struggle for democracy in Korea, culminating in the June 1987 uprising that signaled the end of military dictatorship. And, of course, they would remember the first president since 1945 truly to come from a serious opposition, Kim Dae Jung.The democratic transition that culminated in his election in 1997 and the reforms that he achieved during his presidency resulted in the stable, broad-based, vibrant democracy of the Republic of Korea (ROK) today. When combined with the severe punishment handed out in 1995 to dictator Chun Doo Hwan and his prot챕g챕 Roh Tae Woo, and the various deep inquiries into modern Korean history that ensued (especially the Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission), it is fair to say that there has been no more successful transition from dictatorship to democracy in the world in the past three decades.
