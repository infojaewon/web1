    <p>The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents a
      nd other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertex
      t links, and accessible via the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide
      Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3
      ] The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starti
      ng in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.
